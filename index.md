## Enterprise Applications Developer / Architect

I am an Enterprise Systems Developer / Architect and a Security professional with 17+ years of experience working in the field of implementing packaged software solutions as well as creating custom software designs and implementing custom software. 

When I am not implementing another boring micro-service in Java / Spring Boot, I enjoy learning about new tech, high-level software architecture and design patterns, Test Driven Development, Behavior Driven Development, Service Oriented Architecture, Microservices, Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery, Model Driven Architecture, Business Process Management systems, Business Rules Management systems, and others.

In recent years I have been working in the Insurance industry, but I also participated in engagements and Proof of Concept efforts within many large-scale environments, both public and private.
