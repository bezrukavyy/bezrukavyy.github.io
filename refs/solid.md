# SOLID Design Patterns

S:  Single Responsibility principal. Single class should have single responsibility (function).
O:  Open/closed principal. Classes should be open for extension and closed for modification.
L:  Liskov substitution principal. Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their sub-types. Also known as Design by Contract.
I:  Interface Segregation Principal: Many specific interfaces are better than one generic. No client should depend on methods they do not use.
D:  Dependency Inversion Principal: higher level modules should not depend on lower-level modules, instead both should depend on abstraction.
